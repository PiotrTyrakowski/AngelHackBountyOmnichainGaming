# dino-game
This is a simple game that is inspired by the offline game that appears in the Google Chrome browser when there is no internet connection. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is integrated with metamask and our custom Zetachain NFT to provide in game skin access based on owned nfts
